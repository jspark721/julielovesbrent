    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <h3>When Brent Met Julie...</h3>
    <p>Our story began about 7 years ago when before we even met, I noticed Julie in a group photo my roommate had hanging on our refrigerator door. While drinking my glass of water, I thought to myself, "wow she's cute, I have to meet her!" We eventually met and became friends, but it wasn't until our last year of college that I actually asked Julie out (even though she didn't think it was a date) Obviously it turned out to be an amazing, beautiful first date, and as they say, the rest was history!  We couldn't be happier today. We are now currently enjoying life together in Seattle, WA.</p>
